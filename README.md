# VDesk

VDesk is a fork of [eksime/VDesk](https://github.com/eksime/VDesk) that supports Windows 10 and 11.  
This fork was created because the original project appears to be abandoned.

> **Note:** Due to the migration to .NET Core, the command-line arguments have changed. If you install this version, you will need to adapt your usage of VDesk.
